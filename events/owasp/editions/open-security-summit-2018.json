    "description": "The Open Security Summit 2018 is focused on the collaboration between Developers and Application Security. Using the same model as the previous OWASP Summits, this 5-day event will be a high-energy experience, during which attendees get the chance to work and collaborate intensively. This is not a conference with uni-directional presentations. Every thoroughly prepared working session is geared towards a specific Application Security challenge and will be focused on actionable outcomes.",
