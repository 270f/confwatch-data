    "description": "We want this conference to be the most hands-on, activity-driven con you’ve been to yet! Never worked with a JTAG? You will. Never done a single thing with Software Defined Radio? You will. We will be having an SDR village and a hardware hacking village, among some other great events. The skills you learn here will be directly applicable to your job immediately when you get back to work… or home. We listened to your feedback and this year we’re adding even more lab time, so you can go to as many talks as you can fit AND also do all the activities.",
